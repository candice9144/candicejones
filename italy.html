                 <h3>PEOPLE & CULTURE</h3>
                 
                 <p>Since the rise of the Roman Empire, Italian art, architecture, and culture have had an influence around the world. Famed Italian painters include Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. Italy is also at the heart of the Catholic Church, which is governed from Vatican City, a city-state surrounded by Rome. <br><br>
                  
                    The family is at the center of Italian society. Young people often live at home until they are in their 30s, even if they have a job. When parents retire, they often go to live with their children. <br><br>
                 </p>
                 
                 <h3>GOVERNMENT & ECONOMY</h3>
                   <p> In Italy, politics can often be exciting and noisy. Crowds gather in the streets to protest government policies or to show support for their party. <br><br>
 
                    Since World War II, Italy has enjoyed an economic transformation. Industry grew, and by the mid-1960s, Italy had become one of the world's leading economies. Its main exports are clothing, shoes, food, and wine. <br><br>

                 <h3> FOR FUN </h3>
                 
                 <p>The Colosseum is always under construction. If you engrave anything or try to remove anything you will pay hefty fines or go to jail. Common sense is not so common.<br><br>
                    The Roman Forum is the heart of ancient Rome; it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world, and in all history. - Wikipedia <br><br>
                    The Sistine Chapel is in the Apostolic Palace, the official residence of the Pope, in Vatican City. The Apostolic is about 5 miles long to walk through the whole thing. After walking for FIVE miles, they told us that we could not take any photos.
