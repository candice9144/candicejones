                 <h3>FACTS</h3>
                        <p>
                        <strong>OFFICIAL NAME</strong> : Arab Republic of Egypt|
                        <strong>FORM OF GOVERNMENT</strong> : Republic|
                        <strong>CAPITAL</strong> : Cairo|
                        <strong>POPULATION</strong> : 87, 562, 261|
                        <strong>OFFICIAL LANGUAGE</strong> : Arabic|
                        <strong>MONEY</strong> : Egyptian pound, guinay
                        </p>
                
               
                <h3>PEOPLE & CULTURE</h3>
                <p> About 90 percent of Egyptians are Muslim, which means they are followers of the Islamic religion. About 10 percent of Egyptians are Copts, one of the oldest branches of the Christian religion.<br><br>
 
                    Egypt's population is growing rapidly. This puts strains on Egypt's resources, since most people live in a narrow strip of land along the Nile River. Having so many people in such a small area can cause overcrowding, from schools to apartment buildings to hospitals. <br><br>
 
                    Children are highly valued in Egypt, especially in rural areas where they help on family farms. Children are also expected to look after their parents in their old age. <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>GOVERNMENT & ECONOMY</h3>
                <p>Egypt's geography, population, history, and military strength have made it highly influential in the region. Egypt is a democratic republic, although some critics claim that it is not truly democratic. Until 2005, there was never more than one presidential candidate to vote for. <br><br>

                   Along with oil and gas exports, Egypt's tourism industry remains a key part of its economy. Visitors flock to the country to see ancient monuments like the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx. <br><br>
                </p>
                
                <h3>FOR FUN</h3>
                <p>In Egypt you can negotiate EVERYTHING! A camel ride can cost about 15USD a piece, which was a great deal for an hour tour. <br><br>
                   Tipping is not mandatory but be prepared for rude remarks if you do not tip. EVERYONE expects a tip so make them work for it. <br><br>
                   Other tourists and Egyptian students were very excited to take photos with us. They explained that they rarely see Americans of other complexations in these parts of the world. <br><br>
                   You must have a visa to enter Egypt. U.S. citizens can obtain a renewable single-entry 30-day tourist visa on arrival at Egyptian airports for a 25 USD fee.<br>
